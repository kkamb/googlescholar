# googlescholar

This was a short RA project, where I was asked to collect citations information from google scholar for all the members of the American Finance Association. The problem is that google scholar only allows up to 100 queries a day before your IP is flagged, and I had thousands of finance academics whose citations info I had to collect.

The trick, I found, was that instead of searching google scholar directly, if I instead <a href="https://github.com/kkamb/googlescholar/blob/master/gscholarsearch.pl">searched for the authors in the citations window</a>, I could make up to a thousand queries without my IP being flagged.
